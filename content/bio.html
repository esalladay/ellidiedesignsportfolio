<p>Hello! I am Ellidie Salladay, Web & Graphic Designer with a penchant for learning. I am a self motivated creator dedicated to my work and am currently seeking real world experience in the design industry, specifically in front-end web development.
  My hobbies include taking hikes with my dog and swimming under the sun. When I am not outside, you may find me writing, reading, or lost in a video game.</p>
